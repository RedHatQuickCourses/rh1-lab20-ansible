= Troubleshoot rulebook using CURL and extra_vars

[#in_this_bfx]
== Whatâ€™s in this break-fix?

In this activity, you will troubleshoot SSH authentication and user configuration issues in an Event-Driven Ansible workflow while exploring the use of `extra_vars` in the rulebook.

. SSH into the *node1* instance from the bastion host.

. Note the error generated after the event is captured by the `ansible-rulebook` command
+
.Output
----
Failed to connect to the host via ssh: root@node1: Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic).
----
+
This indicates a failure to connect to the node via SSH.

. Review the rulebook `webhook-example.yml` and the playbook `hello-rh1.yml`.

. Note that two variables are used in the rulebook: `event_name` and `host_host`.  

. The event is matched using the `event_name` variable.  

. The value of the `host_host` variable captured in the event is passed as an extra variable to the playbook.  

. The first task in the playbook uses this hostname variable to add it to the `centrify` group using the `ansible.builtin.add_host` module.  

. This creates a temporary inventory, which is used by the next task in the playbook.  

. The next task installs a package on the hosts in the `centrify` group.  

. The rulebook triggers an event to deploy a package on `node1` from `node1` via inventory host settings. 

. Attempt to SSH from `node1` to itself.  
+
.Output
----
[ec2-user@node1 ~]$ ssh node1
ec2-user@node1: Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic).
[ec2-user@node1 ~]$ 
----
+
The same error is observed as with the playbook.

. Return to the bastion host as `lab-user`.  

. Copy the SSH config and key files from the `lab-user` on the bastion to the `ec2-user` on `node1` to enable passwordless SSH authentication from `node1` to itself.

. Ensure you are in the `02-lab` directory on `node1`.

. Edit the `hello-rh1.yml` playbook and change `remote_user: root` to `remote_user: ec2-user`.

vi hello-rh1.yml

. While the rulebook is still running on `node1`, send the event from the bastion host again.

. Note that the playbook runs successfully this time, and the `Install tcpdump` task is executed.
