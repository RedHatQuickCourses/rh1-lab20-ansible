== Podman

Many customer show TAMs problems with modules within the image.
There are two ways to show the customer what the image (Execution Enviroment) needs to be able to execute the playbook.
Interactive and Declarative
Let's start with the interactive way:
Access the node1 via ssh:

[source,bash]
----
ssh node1
----

Now we will use the ee-supported-rhel8 image.
We can get its path:

image::lab006-001.jpg[lab006-001,100%,100%]

Click on ee-supported-rhel8
click on "copy to clicborad"

image::lab006-002.jpg[lab006-002,100%,100%]

[source,bash]
----
podman pull controller.example.com/ee-supported-rhel8
podman run -it controller.example.com/ee-supported-rhel8 bash 
----

Now inside the container:

Let's create the file playbook.yml

[source,bash]
----
cat > playbook.yml
---
- name: Get all vms
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: yes
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Get VMs list
      community.libvirt.virt:
        command: list_vms
      register: existing_vms

    - name: Debug 
      ansible.builtin.debug: 
        var: existing_vms
----
To save the playbook.yml file "ctrl + d " on an empty line

[source,bash]
----
ssh-keygen
----

ssh-copy-id lab-user@bastion


Let's create the hosts file:

[source,bash]
----
cat > hosts
[all]
bastion

----

Let's run our playbook:

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml
----

We can see from the error that we don't have the collection: community.libvirt.virt



[source,bash]
----
ansible-galaxy collection install community.libvirt
----


Now we can run the playbook:

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml
----
Now it works!!!!!!


== Now with ansible-builder:

Let's start in Declarative mode now:
In declarative mode. Let's create the Execution Enviroment:

[source,bash]
----
ssh node1
cd 06-lab

----

You need to change the token in the ansible.cfg file.

To generate a new token in the HUB. Click on Generation token:

image::lab006-002.jpg[lab006-002,100%,100%]

Now build the Execution Environment:


[source,bash]
----
ansible-builder build --tag=my-lib-virt
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id lab-user@bastion
ansible-navigator run playbook.yml   -i hosts
----

**The real value of this activity lies in your effort to troubleshoot independently.**
